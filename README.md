# **My design manifesto**
### _by Yang Gao_

## **Introduction**
Before we ready to code or finish up a project, we need first to plan out what we should do for that project. Taking this Human Computer Interaction course as an example, every projectwe designed for the course were trying to benefit the users that we will have. Oftentimes engineers will spend months developing technically-sound projects that have little to no purpose in the real world. An excellent software development team will spend months designing a project before even beginning the implementation process. Every single project needs a concrete definition of a worthwhile and evident problem it seeks to solve.

Within learning the Human Computer Interaction for a whole term, it teached me on designing the softwares or projects that I will do. During the designing, [five sheets for designing](http://fds.design) was a useful tool for the process. It presented the group's idea from brainstorming to the final decision and finishing up the developing. By listing out every thoughts on the paper, it's more visiualize for the group and can think into different branches or in a depth way. Plus, the designing process also is a time for the group to check the correctness for the project, and the consistency.

## **Brainstorm and identify the goal**
Everytime when we recieved a topic to design for, the first thing we did was start to brainstorm. Normally, this was the most fun and timecomsuming part for the whole project. During this time period, people threw all the ideas and thought on different topics, and normally teammates picked the topic, that had most thoughts on that as the goal.

Taking the [design for understanding](https://medium.com/@gyang2518/design-documentation-for-understanding-509d4b3aeec) as an example, we picked food as our dataset from 30 different kinds of dataset that's been provided from CORGIS. In the food data there were more than 4000 datas that contains majority nutirients and components in each kind of food, we need to plot three graphs to illustrate the data in the dataset that we chose.

We can't contain everything in our project. We finally decided the goal of these graphs was trying to illustrate which meat, fruit or cereals that people should choose during workout or on a diet or for the people who wants to keep healthy.

Another example would be the project - [design for wellbeing](https://medium.com/@gyang2518/design-documentation-for-wellbeing-a1553f764596). During the brainstorming, we use emotion wellbeing from Affectiva Library to benefit the consumer or the audience. We imported a live chart of how many emotions we had on watching different videos became the most favorite topic that our group had. In the graph, it will illustrate user's emotion at certain time.

## **Initial Design**
Although the goal was determined, the designing process just started. There were lots of possible solutions for same goal. Every solutions are all fit for the goal, however, we should figure out the solution that's not too simple or comprehensive. It's important if we can leave the topic to an open and optional paths. 

In the [designing for Tension](https://medium.com/@gyang2518/design-documentation-of-tension-779f023a98ff), our group suppose to design a chat bot for the users who don't know a lot about Artificial Intellegence. For each categories, we thought about the keywords or main concerns that users might have about AI. For different concerns, it will lead to different specific questions about whether this is the concerns, and then link to a specific article that's actually talk about this topic. We had this basic flow chart and tested it with different peoples to ask about what there concerns. For each categories, we can then think which articles and possible answers to fulfill the chat bot.

Another example would be [Design for Another World](https://medium.com/@gyang2518/design-documentation-for-another-world-1d903c1efd4e), our group decided to do something that can ease the user or make them relax while seeing the Virtual Reality Page. As we all know, there are so many different ways about relaxing. Thus, we though green page can make people relax their eyes. A farm would be a great choice. Within this thought, our group designed a farm with moving animals in it. For this case, there are lots of ways for desiging on relaxation; there are hundreds way of designing on farm. It's our group's responsibility to choose the best solution for the project.


## **Final Design**
Although we have a big picture of the project on the paper, the real design time is now coming. During the process, teamates might already throw away two or three potential final designs. No matter how complicate or straightforward the final solution would be, it contains the all the great thoughts from the team, that must be the best for the team. The "best" also really depends on the group and the project. Some of the team might have good thoughts or structure at the initial design stage; however, the limitation on the ability and time would be the biggest barrels. On [designing for wellbeing](https://medium.com/@gyang2518/design-documentation-for-wellbeing-a1553f764596), our group originally had thoughts on beautify the webpage, make the emoji appear on the graph, and make the live chart and the video start at the same time. However, within the limitation on coding ability for our group, we didn't achieve the goal that our group designed.

However, on [designing for others](https://medium.com/@gyang2518/group-17-design-documentation-fb06fab4fe7a), our group choose Worcester Public Library website as our designing page and our demographic was Parents with toddlers who live 20 miles away from Worcester. Taking the Kids site for example, the paper prototype we had was presented here. In each week, we ordered the event in chronological order, and added the date, so the parents can filter out the event that they can go to and then check the details whether they are interested in or not.

This is the page that we presented final prototype. We firstly designed a close button on each week that the user had to click the close and check next week, which isn't convinient for the page. If more time applied, we should make the color and font contrast more obvious so it would be easier to read for those parents.

## **Conclusion**
After this class, the usage of five design sheet would be used in many other software projects or even a foundamentation for future jobs. Altough right now we only have a week for one project, the whole process we had for the project will be similar to the big projects that we would have in the near future. Thus, the employment of five design sheet or stage - brain storm, initial design, final design - would lead us to a success in next step.

[Good Design](https://medium.com/@gyang2518/good-design-on-school-website-262b0797efc0) &&  [Bad Desing](https://medium.com/@gyang2518/bad-design-on-school-website-be72428fbc22?source=your_stories_page---------------------------)

Good design/Bad design is an exploration of design that is preexisting around us here on WPI’s campus. In these articles I go into detail about the concerns that are raised by poor design considerations and the many benefits of solving many problems through good design application.

[design for others](https://medium.com/@gyang2518/group-17-design-documentation-fb06fab4fe7a)

Design For Others is a redesign challenge that we were given. We were tasked in redesigning a website that already existed for a specific group of people. The purpose of redesigning the page is make the website as clear as possible. Adding quick links and reorganizing the information of the page were the two main aspects that our group focused on.

The dataset that our group pick was from CORGIS talked about Food. There are over 4000 datas in the dataset that contains majority nutirients and components in each kind of food. The design concepts of three graphs are trying to persuade the user to be healthy. First graph, we plot the graph as bar chart that's the ration between protein and fat in 6 big catogries of meat — Beef, Chicken, Fish, Lamb, Pork, Turkey. Second graph, we lay out all the cereals kind in each brand and find out the mean sugar percentage of each brand. Third graph, we plot it as stack with standard deviation so that user can pick the fruit that has more certain vitamin for them among Vitamin A, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin C.

For our chatbot, we used Artificial Intelligences as our topic. It is sarcasm because the chatbot is actually a kind of Artificial Intelligence. However, people don’t really notice that. Nowadays, people are afraid of AI because they do not understand AI or know the background of AI. The stereotype of Artificial Intelligence is the killer AI that appears in Hollywood movies or other fiction movies, which is not really true about AI. Thus, we wanted to list out the fact and truth of the AI and may be convince or at least eliminate the concerns on AI for users, to let the users truly understand about what AI is.

[designing for wellbeing](https://medium.com/@gyang2518/design-documentation-for-wellbeing-a1553f764596)

Designing for wellbeing, we would like to create a website that would help the consumers the most. We had to import the Affectiva Library, that takes the webcamera of the users face and then the output with emoji. Therefore, we decided to do something that can benefit the consumer or the audience. Within the emotion wellbeing, the live chart of how many emotions we had on watching different videos. In the graph, it will illustrate your emotion at certain time.

On the last project for the class, we choose to let people from our class to relax. In the 3D classes, we people can see the farm that has cows and sheeps in it. People can feed the cow and sheep. They also can find the egg in the farm, crack it and then they will get a chicken.
